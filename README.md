# RedisQuest

A fun lil' app that stores a user's quest on a redis server.

To make it work in its current form, you'll need to ensure you have redis installed on your computer (brew install redis) and have the server running (redis-server).

Then just make sure to run npm install, and run npm start to launch the app.

This app is made to practice docker concepts.
